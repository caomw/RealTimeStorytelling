# lecture 3 - tracking distributions

The aim of this session is to explore some methods for keeping track of the distribution of variables in the stream. Our schedule will be:

* quick overview of the Bernoulli and Categorical distributions
* calculating the likelihood of a new message given our distribution
* keeping track of distributions over time
* calcuating the entropy of our distributions over time
* some rabbit holes

BREAK

* remember our stream processing patterns
* discuss strategies for tracking distributions over time
* implement a non-stationary distribution in python and redis
